# CAD-CFD-learning
A documented learning journey through SolidWorks, ANSYS, MATLAB, and OpenFOAM to build engineering and CAD skills.

This repository documents my progress learning SolidWorks, ANSYS, MATLAB, and OpenFOAM as I build my engineering portfolio.  
It includes tutorial notes, screenshots, small projects, and reflections on what I’m learning.

## 📚 Goals
- Learn SolidWorks fundamentals (sketching, parts, assemblies, drawings)
- Build confidence in CAD workflows
- Explore simulations using ANSYS and OpenFOAM
- Create small but meaningful engineering portfolio projects
- Track my progress publicly and consistently
