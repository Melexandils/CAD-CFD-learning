# CAD-CFD-learning
A documented learning journey through SolidWorks, ANSYS, MATLAB, and OpenFOAM to build engineering and CAD skills.

This repository documents my progress learning SolidWorks, ANSYS, MATLAB, and OpenFOAM as I build my engineering portfolio.  
It includes tutorial notes, screenshots, small projects, and reflections on what I’m learning.

## Goals
- Learn SolidWorks fundamentals (sketching, parts, assemblies, drawings)
- Build confidence in CAD workflows
- Explore simulations using ANSYS and OpenFOAM
- Create small but meaningful engineering portfolio projects
- Track my progress publicly and consistently

# Tutorials
Each tutorial includes:
- What I learned  
- Screenshots  
- Notes and mistakes  
- A STEP file of the model (if useful)  

See the `tutorials/` folder for progress.

# Projects
Small, self-contained projects to build confidence and skills, including:
- simple mechanical parts  
- basic aerodynamic shapes  
- assemblies  

More coming soon.

# Long-Term Plan
- Build 10 SolidWorks projects  
- File and document at least 5 ANSYS/OpenFOAM simulations  
- Create a polished engineering portfolio by summer
